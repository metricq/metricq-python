"""
This is an extremely advanced example for deep-dive development and debugging.
This is not used to show how MetricQ is usually used. As normal user of MetricQ
you use the derived classes of :class:`metricq.Client`, e.g.,
:class:`metricq.Source`, :class:`metricq.Sink`:, :class:`metricq.Subscriber`,
or, :class:`metricq.HistoryClient`.

This example shows how to set up a pure `metricq.Client` that can  controlled
with an aiomonitor. After this setup, you can connect to the monitor using
`telnet localhost 50101` (or `netcat`), inspect tasks and run code in a REPL.
