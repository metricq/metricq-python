class IntervalSource(Source):
    """A :term:`Source` producing metrics at regular intervals of time.

    Use an :class:`IntervalSource` if you want to produce data points at a constant rate,
    without having to worry about getting the timing right.
    Put your code producing data points into :meth:`update`, which gets called
    at the specified intervals.

    The :class:`IntervalSource` handles missed deadlines for you:
    If the code in :meth:`update` takes longer than :attr:`period` to execute,
    it will skip the next updates until it caught up, otherwise keeping a
    constant update rate.


    Keyword Args:
        period: time between consecutive updates, in number of seconds or as :class:`Timedelta`

    Example:
        Sending an incrementing counter once a second::

            from metricq import IntervalSource, rpc_handler

            class Counter(IntervalSource):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    super().__init__(*args, period=Timedelta.from_s(1), **kwargs)
                    self.counter = 0

                @rpc_handler("config")
                async def _on_config(self, **_config):
                    await self.declare_metrics(["example.counter"])

                async def update(self):
                    await self.send("example.counter", time=Timestamp.now(), value=self.counter)

        *Must* be set to a :class:`Timedelta` before :meth:`update` is run for the first time.

        To change the update period at a later time, overwrite this value.
        The change will be picked up before :meth:`update` is run the next time.

        Note:
            Setting this value to :code:`None` in application code is *not* supported and will raise a :exc:`TypeError`.
            In particular:
